This is some code for explorations into multi-sensory expression. Check out this post for some details: <a href='http://ztribbett.herokuapp.com/blog/2013/04/22/the-color-of-music/' target='_BLANK'>The Color of Music</a>

Lots to be developed but if you're feeling adventurous and wanting to hack... 

The code under color\_follower will run in just the regular Processing environment. 

The code under us\_audio\_color\_follower will require an arduino, the arduino programming environment, 4 wires, an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004U8TOE6/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1" target='_BLANK'>ultrasonic sensor</a>, an a breadboard to tie it all together. Both the arduino and processing code are in the folder. 

Hack away. Express yourself. Enjoy. :)
